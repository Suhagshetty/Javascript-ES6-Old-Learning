# JavaScript Mastery — Part 1: Learning Journey

> **This repo is Part 1 of my learning.**

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository documents my JavaScript learning journey (ES6+). It contains notes, examples, mini-projects, and practice problems I covered while learning JavaScript as my first programming language. The content is inspired by tutorials and courses like Chai aur Code and Jonas Schmedtmann.

## 📂 What’s inside (high level)

* Core JavaScript topics: variables, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, functions, scope, arrays, objects, and DOM basics.
* ES6+ features: template literals, destructuring, spread/rest, default params, modules, classes, Promises, async/await, Fetch API, and new built-in collections (Map/Set).
* Advanced topics: closures, higher-order functions, prototypes & inheritance, `this`, execution context, event loop, error handling, debouncing & throttling.
* Mini projects & practice: Counter App, Color Changer, To-Do List (planned), BMI Calculator, Weather App (API), Digital Clock, Quote Generator.

## 🧭 Suggested learning path (Part 1)

1. **Basics**: `let/const/var`, data types, operators, conditionals.
2. **Control Flow**: loops (`for`, `while`, `for...of`), array methods (`forEach`, `map`, `filter`, `reduce`).
3. **Functions**: declarations, expressions, arrow functions, scope and closures.
4. **Objects & Arrays**: manipulation, destructuring, spread/rest.
5. **DOM Basics**: selectors, events, modifying elements.
6. **ES6+ features**: template literals, modules, classes, Promises.
7. **Small Projects**: build Counter, Color Changer, and To-Do to practice concepts.

## 🛠️ How to use this repo

* Open the folders for topic-wise notes and examples.
* Run any front-end examples by opening the HTML files in the browser or using a simple static server (e.g., `npx http-server` or VS Code Live Server).
* For Node/modern JS examples, ensure Node.js is installed and run files with `node filename.js`.
